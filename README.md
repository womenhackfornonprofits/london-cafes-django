# Description
This is volunteer idea to create a web app that will display and allow searching of curated cafes places that are team friendly to go and spend some time hacking together on a project.

The user can come to the website and search bases on London postcode/locations to find a curated list of cafes matching that criteria. The cafes should be shown on a map as well.
Each cafe will be handpicked and “features” ranked like wifi signal, how great is the coffee/food and space etc.

## Tech
- Django (a Python framework)
- Front end SASS/HTML5 and a frontend framework perhaps Bootstrap or Concise CSS
- Gulp or Grunt for frontend build
- Possibly JS for some interactions/ lazy loading images etc
- Github
- Heroku for free hosting
- Perhaps AWS/Cloud Flare CDN for image storage
- Github Issues for tasks
- Slack for group chats/standups etc

# Contributing
Please follow a few guidelines in order to contribute to the project:

1. Pick an issue in the [backlog](https://github.com/womenhackfornonprofits/we-meet-django/issues) and assign it to yourself.
2. Always create a new branch `git branch branch_name` and all changes you make should be in that branch.
3.  Make the changes needed then save and commit them:
	- Use `git status` to see what changes there are that can be committed.
	- To add a file to be commited: ```git add filename``` *(this will stage the file for a commit)*
	- Once all files you want to commit are added you can  commit the changes ```git commit``` and make sure to add a meaningful message to describe what changes you have made.
4. [Raise a Pull Request](## How to raise a Pull Request
) so other teammembers can review the changes before they are merged5. 
5. Have at least 1 team member review your code *(ideally 2)* and once you receive a :+1: you can merge the code.
